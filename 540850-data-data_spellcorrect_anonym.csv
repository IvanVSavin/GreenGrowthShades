In this way carbon pricing creates an implicit strategy of moving from low to high cost mitigation measures. A second advantage is that taxes and auctioned allowances generate revenue for the government.","The corresponding limitations of carbon pricing instruments are that they: o	Do not encourage adoption of higher cost (cost per tCO2e higher than the tax or allowance price) mitigation actions/technologies such as adoption of renewable energy technologies and measures to abate industrial process emissions. o	Have limited impact on adoption of mitigation measures in situations where decisions are not sensitive to price incentives such as recycling, household energy efficiency, transportation, urban planning, choice of infrastructure and scope of electricity grids. o	Have limited impact on long-term investments such as R&D and new facilities.",4,4,4,5,5,3,3,3,6,5,"The questions implicitly presume that carbon pricing is the only policy.

While theoretical literature favours international, ideally global, policy harmonization experience for carbon pricing and all other policies reveals this does not happen in practice.   ",66,,Carbon pricing evokes strong views with advocates suggesting that it should be a jurisdiction's main mitigation policy and critics claiming that it is ineffective. As noted above carbon pricing has both strengths and weaknesses.  ,Almost no government that levies a carbon tax regularly reports the taxed emissions (all ETSs report actual emissions) so it is very difficult to track the environmental impact of carbon taxes.

For phasing-out fossil fuel use I would say supply-side instruments are to be preferred in a first line to demand-side. The high profit margins in fossil fuel industry are such strong drivers for putting fuels on the markets.  Supply-side instruments would directly target the industry e.g., strict control of methane emissions, direct subsidies to renewable energy and infrastructure investments. 2. May also be easier to rally public support for supply-side instruments. Although they are likely to increase costs and some be transferred to market prices, it's clearer to consumers why costs have increased if they can be linked to e.g., direct methane regulations. 3. From an equity point of view, it does not seem reasonable to drive decarbonization primarily via consumer choices. We know that such instruments can hit bluntly on different groups (e.g., long-distance commuters as in the case of the yellow vests). Better then to focus on supply-side and e.g., extend public transport infrastructure, upgrade railway systems etc, making these attractive choices before you introduce taxes and higher costs for carbon-intensive choices when consumers do not have the choices.

A cap-and-trade scheme for individuals (personal carbon allowances) scores higher for equity than an upstream scheme like the EU ETS where the costs get passed down to the consumer. I also wasn't really clear about the 'efficiency' question - information provision is low cost so low welfare sacrifice, but since it achieves very little it's not really efficient because the costs are potentially high compared to what is actually achieved.

I favor a personal carbon allowance or carbon credit card as proposed by David Miliband, Centre for Sustainable Energy and DEFRA in 2007 - it is even more feasible now as it is easier to calculate carbon footprint of more goods and services. Miliband thought that everyone could have a carbon credit card – and every transaction, journey and purchase would require the credit card to be swiped, and more or less would come off depending on the carbon footprint of your purchase. If you ran out of credit, and needed more, you could purchase off of someone who still had a lot of carbon on their credit card. This idea is an alternative to green taxation. Although green taxes allow more individual freedom, they make environmentally harmful behavior the privilege of the rich, which isn’t fair. A carbon credit card is more like a kind of rationing as everyone has the same carbon allowance which is fairer, but there is still some room to manoeuvre if you allow unspent carbon to be sold to those who need more than they have. Hence when others have run out of carbon, they can buy some of the leftover carbon from those who aren’t using as much.",Not sure cap and trade is enough to STOP fossil fuel extraction and use.

We have high risk Investments into new Technologies that Need R&D funding, we have Investment barriers where the sufficient amount of Money needed for the initial Investment is simply not available to make a more climate friendly decision (even though it may be more financially attractive over the lifetime of the Technology), we have high requirements for Returns on Investments in industry, which despite of Carbon Prices cannot be met, we have Investment dilemmas where the owner of a house does not live in the house and hence does not Profit from the Investment into insulation or a new renewable heating System.

At the same time, expecting the whole transition to be driven exclusively by carbon pricing is problematic because the institutional basis for such a mechanism to work is absent or partial in many countries in the world. China is a good example of that. Studies carefully attributing the  past and observed effects (not the projected effects) of different carbon pricing mechanisms, as opposed to other policies and/or other factors such as economic slowdown or de-industrialization / economic restructuring and delocalization are needed on emissions reduction.  Furthermore, the ""polluter pays"" principle embodied in carbon pricing mechanisms find their limits when the polluter is everybody, and especially individuals who are locked-in carbon-dependent infrastructures, ways of life, geographies and employments. Positive, appealing transition pathways need to be drawn for them before they're punished for not supporting it. ",interaction with other measures based on real data instead of projections.

Carbon tax: creates revenue for governments, can encourage R&D spending re renewable energy, may be able to influence the decisions of energy users, creates an incentive for companies to go green, can be an effective mitigation strategy. Can be effective at influencing decisions of companies as well if the price of the tax is high enough that it can’t be easily passed on to consumers. Cap-and-trade: Is good because it creates a total cap on fossil fuel emissions - there will be a finite limit. This can take less time to develop potentially than a carbon tax and it can lead to faster cuts in pollution. This creates government revenue because the credits for carpentry can be auctioned off and the government can control the system. Companies may purchase credits to ensure that they have enough in case they need to match a certain amount of greenhouse gases, but then they may actually find that they do not need to use them and can retire the products. Since there is a finite level of emissions permitted within a cabin trade system the retiring of such credits would basically create a lower. Those credits would not go back into an auction or be traded to another company necessarily, they can be fully retired such that no fossil fuels allocated to that credit are emitted.","Both systems create more costs for companies which can and likely will be passed on at least to some degree to consumers. Carbon tax: Carbon taxes can be very resource intensive and time intensive to develop. In a Federalist country like Canada, there can be litigation that ensues over a federal government imposing a requirement to develop a carbon tax and each province and if different states within the same country are given flexibility to design their own carbon tax scheme then there can be a variation of programs across the nation which will not necessarily complement one another and may have varying degrees of efficiency. There is no cap on the amount of emissions that are permitted; as long as individuals and/or companies can afford to pay the price, they will be able to continue on without adjusting their energy consumption behaviors at all. The carbon tax may create an incentive for companies to relocate their head offices to avoid taxes - carbon tax schemes would need to take this into account. Can have devastating effects for low-middle class people and members of vulnerable groups. Designing exemption programs can be very complex and will be controlled by governments that may not do a good job at ensuring vulnerable peoples are not impacted by the tax.

Some states may be hesitant to provide exemptions and the rationale is they fear it will be contrary to their efforts but I believe this to be untrue. More research is needed to demonstrate that carbon pricing can still function well and achieve the desired outcomes even while ensuring the most vulnerable aren’t impacted. - research on revenue recycling and uses of proceeds from carbon pricing would be helpful as well in order to further support whether this has an impact on R&D or if companies/families who receive rebates etc are likely to actually use this revenue to go green,9,3,5,1,4,1,31,,32,,,3,,

I specifically added applied public research funding (for climate-relevant research) because many countries have much lower levels of public research funding generally than is likely to be economically optimal and/or direct funding towards objectives that are unsupportive of or even conflicting with climate mitigation and adaptation.","The main strength of carbon pricing is that it can provide a uniform carbon price that applies to all emissions-generating activities in an economy with modest costs for implementation and compliance activities.  In contrast, directly regulating these activities would inevitably generate large variation in shadow carbon prices across activities and would require a huge bureaucracy. While the question presumably refers to a domestic carbon price, it is also possible to put a price on carbon-intensive imports. This was previously seen as a (possibly) theoretically desirable but (likely) politically impractical measure to avoid international emissions leakage. However, it seems likely such measures could now be implemented by large countries/blocs like the US, EU and China, not only for the stated purpose of limiting leakage, but to economically coerce recalcitrant governments (e.g. Australia) to take domestic policy actions.","The key advantage of domestic carbon pricing over regulation in developed countries that do not already have such a price has probably been lost at this point. In countries like Australia, it is almost impossible to conceive of any policy involving an obvious carbon price mechanism being politically feasible, as a result of misinformation propagated during past vitriolic debates.

The first is that a carbon price can easily exacerbate inequalities, because any costs are often passed onto consumers. These additional costs have disproportional effects on the poor compared with the rich. Rebates from the tax collected can mitigate this to some extent, but it's not clear how well this will actually work. The second (and perhaps bigger) problem is that it becomes far too easy for decision-makers in capitalist systems to assume that a carbon price is all that's needed to address climate change. It is highly likely other policies will be required, but too much attention gets paid to the carbon price.

We know that direct regulation is less efficient than carbon pricing from simple economic considerations.","We also know from experience that some sectors are more politically able to resist direct regulation than others - thus regulatory approaches tend to exempt certain sectors and affect others.

It seems to me that the only thing that can limit the growth of that price is technology, which can find substitutes as the price on the pollutant gets higher. In the real world, though, the other lever than can halt the rise of that price is politics, as fossil revanchists make the case that (1) the price is too high in view of (2) the fact that competitors have nowhere near as high a price.

They always include carve outs or rebates for emitting industries, reducing their effectiveness.
