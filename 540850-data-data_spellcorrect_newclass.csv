For phasing-out fossil fuel use I would say supply-side instruments are to be preferred in a first line to demand-side. The high profit margins in fossil fuel industry are such strong drivers for putting fuels on the markets.  Supply-side instruments would directly target the industry e.g., strict control of methane emissions, direct subsidies to renewable energy and infrastructure investments. 2. May also be easier to rally public support for supply-side instruments. Although they are likely to increase costs and some be transferred to market prices, it's clearer to consumers why costs have increased if they can be linked to e.g., direct methane regulations. 3. From an equity point of view, it does not seem reasonable to drive decarbonization primarily via consumer choices. We know that such instruments can hit bluntly on different groups (e.g., long-distance commuters as in the case of the yellow vests). Better then to focus on supply-side and e.g., extend public transport infrastructure, upgrade railway systems etc, making these attractive choices before you introduce taxes and higher costs for carbon-intensive choices when consumers do not have the choices. Bottom line: Drive decarbonization first through supply-side regulations and investments and when choices have been fully developed then it's time for demand-side instruments like carbon tax or cap-and-trade to make consumers move to the better choices.",4,3,4,5,2,4,4,1,4,1,Commenting on the last j) statement: if you want carbon prices to fix the climate problem then you cannot use it as a tax base.

I also wasn't really clear about the 'efficiency' question - information provision is low cost so low welfare sacrifice, but since it achieves very little it's not really efficient because the costs are potentially high compared to what is actually achieved.

I favor a personal carbon allowance or carbon credit card as proposed by David Miliband, Centre for Sustainable Energy and DEFRA in 2007 - it is even more feasible now as it is easier to calculate carbon footprint of more goods and services. Miliband thought that everyone could have a carbon credit card – and every transaction, journey and purchase would require the credit card to be swiped, and more or less would come off depending on the carbon footprint of your purchase. If you ran out of credit, and needed more, you could purchase off of someone who still had a lot of carbon on their credit card. This idea is an alternative to green taxation. Although green taxes allow more individual freedom, they make environmentally harmful behavior the privilege of the rich, which isn’t fair. A carbon credit card is more like a kind of rationing as everyone has the same carbon allowance which is fairer, but there is still some room to manoeuvre if you allow unspent carbon to be sold to those who need more than they have. Hence when others have run out of carbon, they can buy some of the leftover carbon from those who aren’t using as much.",Not sure cap and trade is enough to STOP fossil fuel extraction and use.

Furthermore, the ""polluter pays"" principle embodied in carbon pricing mechanisms find their limits when the polluter is everybody, and especially individuals who are locked-in carbon-dependent infrastructures, ways of life, geographies and employments.

Carbon tax: creates revenue for governments, can encourage R&D spending re renewable energy, may be able to influence the decisions of energy users, creates an incentive for companies to go green, can be an effective mitigation strategy. Can be effective at influencing decisions of companies as well if the price of the tax is high enough that it can’t be easily passed on to consumers. Cap-and-trade: Is good because it creates a total cap on fossil fuel emissions - there will be a finite limit. This can take less time to develop potentially than a carbon tax and it can lead to faster cuts in pollution. This creates government revenue because the credits for carpentry can be auctioned off and the government can control the system. Companies may purchase credits to ensure that they have enough in case they need to match a certain amount of greenhouse gases, but then they may actually find that they do not need to use them and can retire the products. Since there is a finite level of emissions permitted within a cabin trade system the retiring of such credits would basically create a lower. Those credits would not go back into an auction or be traded to another company necessarily, they can be fully retired such that no fossil fuels allocated to that credit are emitted.","Both systems create more costs for companies which can and likely will be passed on at least to some degree to consumers. Carbon tax: Carbon taxes can be very resource intensive and time intensive to develop. In a Federalist country like Canada, there can be litigation that ensues over a federal government imposing a requirement to develop a carbon tax and each province and if different states within the same country are given flexibility to design their own carbon tax scheme then there can be a variation of programs across the nation which will not necessarily complement one another and may have varying degrees of efficiency. There is no cap on the amount of emissions that are permitted; as long as individuals and/or companies can afford to pay the price, they will be able to continue on without adjusting their energy consumption behaviors at all. The carbon tax may create an incentive for companies to relocate their head offices to avoid taxes - carbon tax schemes would need to take this into account. Can have devastating effects for low-middle class people and members of vulnerable groups. Designing exemption programs can be very complex and will be controlled by governments that may not do a good job at ensuring vulnerable peoples are not impacted by the tax. This is an issue in Canada with exemptions for Indigenous Peoples.",2,2,4,1,1,3,5,3,3,5,,,1,Such a difficult thing to estimate especially considering many environmental lawyers will be employed by fossil fuel dependent companies and I do not know the proportion of lawyers that are employed by companies versus those defending the environment. ,- effectiveness and stringency of different designs of carbon pricing schemes could be further evaluated so that countries without carbon pricing in place could benefit from guidelines and best practices as well as case studies that demonstrate success. - research on how best to approach exemptions for vulnerable groups (especially Indigenous Peoples and communities) from carbon taxes and whether such exemptions will adversely impact gag reductions efforts would be very helpful. Some states may be hesitant to provide exemptions and the rationale is they fear it will be contrary to their efforts but I believe this to be untrue. More research is needed to demonstrate that carbon pricing can still function well and achieve the desired outcomes even while ensuring the most vulnerable aren’t impacted. - research on revenue recycling and uses of proceeds from carbon pricing would be helpful as well in order to further support whether this has an impact on R&D or if companies/families who receive rebates etc are likely to actually use this revenue to go green,9,3,5,1,4,1,31,,32,,,3,,,Alicia.campney@gmail.com

Of course, it is possible to apply cap-and-trade to some emissions and a carbon tax to others. R&D subsidies are extremely important for countries that are large and near the global technology frontier. Less so for others. I specifically added applied public research funding (for climate-relevant research) because many countries have much lower levels of public research funding generally than is likely to be economically optimal and/or direct funding towards objectives that are unsupportive of or even conflicting with climate mitigation and adaptation.","The main strength of carbon pricing is that it can provide a uniform carbon price that applies to all emissions-generating activities in an economy with modest costs for implementation and compliance activities.  In contrast, directly regulating these activities would inevitably generate large variation in shadow carbon prices across activities and would require a huge bureaucracy. While the question presumably refers to a domestic carbon price, it is also possible to put a price on carbon-intensive imports. This was previously seen as a (possibly) theoretically desirable but (likely) politically impractical measure to avoid international emissions leakage. However, it seems likely such measures could now be implemented by large countries/blocs like the US, EU and China, not only for the stated purpose of limiting leakage, but to economically coerce recalcitrant governments (e.g. Australia) to take domestic policy actions.","The key advantage of domestic carbon pricing over regulation in developed countries that do not already have such a price has probably been lost at this point. In countries like Australia, it is almost impossible to conceive of any policy involving an obvious carbon price mechanism being politically feasible, as a result of misinformation propagated during past vitriolic debates.

Similarly (and somewhat overlapping) fungibility of pricing between CO2 emissions and removals from atmosphere may be problematic due to asymmetrical physical effects on the climate system (at least beyond global ""net zero"") and high variability in the permanence of purported removals.",9,2,7,1,35,2,81,,1,,,4,Most of my research career has been in interdisciplinary complex systems; but it is only in the last 10 years that I have applied this in the specific context of the planetary ecological emergency.,,barry.mcmullin@dcu.ie

It would also be useful to see the extent to which a carbon tax on its own or as a suite of measures aimed at climate mitigation (and with other co benefits such as reducing air pollution) can be more effective (in terms of reducing emissions and increasing or maintaining social acceptance and doing so more equitably).",7,3,6,3,17,1,31,,32,,,4,,,
